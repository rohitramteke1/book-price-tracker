# How to Run Your Price Tracker Project

## 1. Set Up Your Environment

First, make sure you have a Python virtual environment set up and all dependencies installed.

```bash
# 1. Create a virtual environment (only needs to be done once)
python -m venv venv

# 2. Activate it
# On Windows (PowerShell/CMD):
.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Configure the Scraper (Optional)

Your scraper is now highly configurable! Open `scrape.py` and edit the configuration variables at the top to control what you scrape.

```python
# --- CONFIGURATION in scrape.py ---
URL = "https://books.toscrape.com/"  # Or change to a specific category URL
PRICE_ALERT_THRESHOLD = 20.0        # Set to None to disable alerts
PRICE_FILTER_MAX = None             # Set a price to only log books below it
TITLE_KEYWORD_FILTER = ''           # Set a keyword to only log matching titles
```

## 3. Run the Scraper

Now you can run the scraper from your terminal. It will collect data according to your configuration and save it to `data/price_log.csv`.

```bash
python scrape.py
```
*(Note: If you want to use the dynamic URL from the dashboard instead, you can skip this step and go straight to the dashboard.)*

## 4. Launch the Interactive Dashboard

This is where you can see all your data come to life. Run the following command:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
This will open a new tab in your web browser with the dashboard.

**From the dashboard, you can:**
-   **Scrape dynamically:** Use the "Scraper Controls" in the sidebar to enter any URL and number of pages, then click "Scrape Now".
-   **Analyze your data:** Use the "Dashboard" and "Analysis" tabs to explore charts, stats, and tables.

## 5. Run the Command-Line Analysis (Optional)

For a quick, text-based summary of your data, you can run `analyze.py`. You can even use filters!

```bash
# Get a full analysis
python analyze.py

# Or, run with filters
python analyze.py title=love pricemin=10 pricemax=20
```

## 6. Run the Test Suite

To ensure that your scraping logic is working correctly, you can run the test suite.

```bash
pytest test_scrape.py
```
